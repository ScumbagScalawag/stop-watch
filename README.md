PP1 - Stop Watch 

The teacher has issued a challenge: the student in her class
that gets the best time running from CHE to ENA and back out of
3 round trips will be given extra credit on the next exam!

## Here's how it works:
Run `make` in the same directory as the rest of the files in this project.

If this doesn't work, simply run the following:
`g++ -Wall pp1.cpp runner.cpp emptyStack.cpp -o pp1`

To run the program, run:
`./pp1`
